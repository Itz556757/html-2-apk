<br >
Now,you have created a new android project.The project's home directory is the /AppProjects/MyApp directory in your phone.


## Modify file

Download files I had provided.
<br >
```git clone https://github.com/ymrdf/html-2-apk```
<br >
Open up /AppProjects/MyApp/app/src/main using your file browser,replace 'AndroidManifest.xml' with the file of the same name which you just download.
<br >
Next ,replace /AppProjects/MyApp/app/src/main/java/com/mycompany/myapp/MainActivity.java.
<br >
Next ,replace /AppProjects/MyApp/app/src/main/res/layout/main.xml.
<br >
At last,copy the 'assets' folder into /AppProjects/MyApp/app/src/main.There is a sample html app in assets/www,you can replace it with your own.Only one thing to note,the html file must be 'index.html'.


## Test


Now,you can see the effect.
